DRBL (Diskless Remote Boot in Linux).
Description:
DRBL provides a diskless or systemless environment for client machines. It works on Debian, Ubuntu, Mandriva, Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS and OpenSuSE. DRBL uses distributed hardware resources and makes it possible for clients to fully access local hardware. It also includes Clonezilla, a partition and disk cloning utility similar to Symantec Ghost(TM) or True Image(TM).

- update language files.
- If files are put in /tftpboot/node_root/drbl_ssi/clients/$IP/, it will be copied to DRBL client when client boots. By doing this, we can assign some special setting for DRBL SSI client. Check /tftpboot/node_root/drbl_ssi/clients/00_README for more details.

- if udev is found in the server, we won't try to see if dev and MAKEDEV rpm exist in the repository.
- For FC6, since start_udev uses udevtrigger now instead of udevstart, we add this in init.drbl "[ -x /sbin/udevtrigger ] && /sbin/udevtrigger".
- change "-i|--skip-client-kernel-install" to "-p|--skip-client-kernel-install" to avoid confusion with "drblsrv -i".

* Wed Oct 11 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.6-2
- use $DRBL_SCRIPT_PATH/sbin/drblpush instead of $DRBL_SCRIPT_PATH/setup/drblpush in dcs.
- bug fixed: we should read all the config parameters, those missing are: $client_root_passwd $client_pxelinux_passwd $clonezilla_box_mode $drbl_ssi_mode $account_passwd_length and $client_autologin_passwd. Hence "drblpush -c /etc/drbl/drblpush.conf" works now.

* Mon Oct 09 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.5-11
- bug fixed: For SuSE, actually the config file is in /etc/opt/kde3/share/config/kdm/kdmrc, therefore put /etc/ in the beginning in drbl-functions.

* Mon Oct 09 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.5-10
- only when /var/lib/{rpm,dpkg} exists, we will create /tftpboot/nodes/$ip/var/lib/{rpm,dpkg}. This fixed the bug that auto login account does not match the hostname when auto login is chosen in DRBL SSL mode.
- bug fixed: we should use the existing nisdomainname as the default value if it exists.

* Mon Oct 09 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.5-9
- remove unnecessary script sbin/modify_gdm_cfg_block.
- bug fixed: GDM_CFG & KDM_CFG should be queried to obtained by rpm or dpkg in drbl_ssi_client_prepare, and the auto login id now can match the hostname.
- init.drbl now will mount /var/lib/{dpkg,rpm} before running drbl_ssi_client_prepare if it's DRBL SSI mode.
- we show 3 different modes: Full DRBL mode, DRBL SSI mode and Clonezilla box mode when booting running init.drbl so that it won't confuse people why in Clonezilla mode, it still shows DRBL SSI mode.
- GDM_CFG, FAC_GDM_CFG and KDM_CFG are got in drbl-functions, no more set in drbl.conf.
- in dcs, -z3 is always the default one no matter it's ntfsclone or partimage.  Give more example, like sda, sda1 sda2 in clonezilla save.

* Sun Oct 08 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.5-8

- fixed the bug that client's gdm theme is not correctly set in the client (drblpush).
- default to show -j0 (off) in dcs (not -j) now, since now we change the create_part_by_sfdisk=yes as default.

* Thu Oct 05 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.5-5
- if domainname is "localdomain", we use default vaule: drbl.sf.net in drblpush.

* Wed Oct 04 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.5-3
- reiserfs program and ddrescue are not necessary programs (drbl.conf).
- add ramdisk_blocksize=1024 for client's kernel parameter in generate-pxe-menu (http://www.mail-archive.com/rhelv5-beta-list@redhat.com/msg00086.html), since in kernel 2.6.18, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_BLOCKSIZE=4096 in FC5.92 is too small for network initrd.
- For kernel 2.6.18, it seems if root is ro, all the mount later (such as /etc, /var) will be ro in init.drbl, so remount the root filesystem read-write in init.drbl.
- Do not set drbl theme GDM config in the server and drbl.spec, only for clients.
- add an option (set_drbl_gdmgreeter) in drbl.conf so that we can decide to set DRBL gdm greeting background for DRBL clients or not.
- If drbl SSI and clonezilla box is not set, template tarball won't be created when running drblpush.
- bug fixed: unable to get nisdomainname in parse_net_conf in FC.
- we can always set domainname and nisdomainname everytime when running drblpush.
- This release should work in FC6.

- use "XFdrake --auto" in firstboot for MDV 2007.0.
- use grep -E '\.deb\>' & grep -E '\.rpm\>' instead of grep -E '\.deb$' & grep -E '\.rpm$' in list_available_deb list_available_rpm for ftp repository
- Some repo output DOS (CR/LF), convert to Unix format: sed# 's/.$//' in list_available_deb list_available_rpm.
- rewrite the method to add urpmi repository in mandriva, just use "--distrib --probe-synthesis"
- new upstream syslinux 3.31.
- for newer distribution, since no smp kernel package availalbe, we won't ask if client will use smp kernel or not.

- This release and clonezilla should work for Ubuntu Edgy (6.10) now.

* Sun Sep 24 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.4-18
- bug fixed: if /etc/rc2.d/S99[gk]dm does not exist in server, now it will be created in client, and we set it as S13[gk]dm for all debian-based distribution. Hence gdm/kdm starts earlier than before.
- add subtree_check and no_subtree_check for exports in drbl-nfs-exports
- move drblthincli to S12drblthincli for all debian-based distribution.
- new upstream syslinux 3.31-pre4.

* Fri Sep 22 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.4-17

- move firstboot for Debian to rcS.d
- create /etc/inittab for client when using upstart.

* Thu Sep 21 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.4-16
- since Ubuntu edgy uses dash as the default sh (/bin/sh), to avoid error in dash, we use "> /dev/null 2>&1" instead of "&>/dev/null" in perl (drblpush)
- if "drblsrv-offline -i", we still create the NBI.
- add usplash as client service in ubuntu or debian.
- check if the dm exists or not before set that for client, if not, show warning.

* Fri Sep 15 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.4-8
- Now clonezilla can not be multi-image, so it will be a mess if just stop some clients. Therefore if IP_LIST exists, we still stop all the clonezilla process.
- In debian unstable, the mountnfs.sh from initscripts 2.86.ds1-19 or later use the same skill with waitnfs.sh, so we use the same way to fix the NFS problem.

* Thu Sep 14 2006 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ nchc org tw> 1.7.4-7

- bug fixed: "-p true" description missing in dcs.
- find the etherwake/ether-wake program first in drbl-doit. For FC: ether-wake, for Debian: etherwake.
- Bug fixed: in Mandrake 10.0, for init.drbl, we put dev.tgz as the first priority, higher than udev, so that if necessary, such MDK 10, we can force to use dev.tgz instead of udev. (Since in MDK10, there is /sbin/udev, but no /sbin/udevstart or /sbin)

Check /opt/drbl/doc/examples/drblsrv-offline*.txt to see how to use it. For paramaters of drblsrv-offline, use "drblsrv-offline --help" to get them. Note! You still have to run "/opt/drbl/sbin/drblpush -i" after drblsrv-offline.
- when local kernel in the server is chosen, we force to use the KARCH from the server, otherwise maybe the kernel in the repository has different CPU arch.
- use "dpkg -L drbl &> /dev/null" instead of "dpkg -s drbl &> /dev/null" to check if drbl deb is installed or not.
- add "-p poweroff" for clonezilla in dcs.
